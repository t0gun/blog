## How do I introduce myself?
I build and maintain software systems, secure critical infrastructure, and I also contribute
to [open source](https://github.com/t0gun).I write about things I am learning or failing at, sometimes my posts are
not technical and might just be a reflection about something,a problem I have encountered or a fix.You can dig in if
interested. You can reach me through email (apprentice_py{at}icloud.com).
