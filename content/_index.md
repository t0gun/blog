## How do I introduce myself?

I build and maintain software systems, secure critical infrastructure, and occasionally contribute
to [open source](https://github.com/t0gun) on GitHub. This site exists to  help me solidify what
Iâ€™m learning, breaking or failing at. You can reach me through email (apprentice_py{at}icloud.com).
