## How do I introduce myself?
I build and maintain software systems, secure critical infrastructure, and occasionally contribute
to [open source](https://github.com/t0gun) on GitHub. This blog exists to sharpen my writing and help me solidify what
I’m learning or breaking. I’ve written a mix of technical content and personal takes...browse the menu if you want to 
dig in.

I am currently building go-spf, An rfc compliant SPF (Sender Policy Framework) implementation in go
