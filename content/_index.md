## How do I introduce myself?

I build and maintain software systems, secure critical infrastructure, and occasionally contribute
to [open source](https://github.com/t0gun) on GitHub. This blog exists to sharpen my writing and help me solidify what
I’m learning or breaking. I’ve written a mix of technical content and personal takes...browse the menu if you want to
dig in. You can reach me through email (apprentice_py{at}icloud.com).
