Certifications are a hot thing in techâ€¦anyone familiar with LinkedIn should have seen people having a few to hundreds
of different badges swarming their profiles. At one point in my life... I was riding on that train. Before I started my
degree in cybersecurity...I was looking for ways to upskill and, at the same time, earn credibility to land an
entry-level security role, which was what led me to certifications.

After much research, I enrolled for my first computer networking certification, the Network+ from CompTiA.After passing
the exam with just one month of preparation, I passed the Security+ the following month, and that was before I started
my cybersecurity degree. I thought I was a genius.

When I started looking for jobs, the employers who listed these certifications as a requirement did not pay attention
to them; they only care about the experience you have gathered either from building something exceptional or your work
experience.

Even if the certifications I did during those years were basic entry-level certs. The same rule still applies to
advanced certs. Credibility can never be handed over; it is earned over time. I will not write certs off completely, for
some people, that's the level-up game, certs got them the job, the pay raise, the promotion, but it is a game I chose to
opt out of. It's expensive, unreliable and risky.

I don't force myself to learn loads of stuff upfront to prove myself to an employer. I follow the just-in-time-based
learning approach, where I only learn what I need for a specific task and allow my skills to compound naturally through
real-world experience and constant iteration. If you're considering pursuing certifications, ask yourself the following
questions:

- Is it worth it?
- Would you be better off creating a tailored learning path for yourself?
- Do you simply want to display badges on your LinkedIn profile?
- Are there other ways to prove your skills to an employer?
- Do you need to go to such lengths to demonstrate your expertise?

You should find your answers easily.
