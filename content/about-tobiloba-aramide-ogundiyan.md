# About

Hi I am Toby.

I write Go, build backend systems, and obsess over security and reliability.
This blog is a dump of what I'm learning or breaking â€” from email infrastructure and testing to containers and distributed systems.

I like reliable systems, clean code, and figuring things out the hard way. I treat this blog as a working notebook, not a portfolio â€” thinking in public, mistakes and all.
Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving and learning about email protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), building tooling under [Apprentice Systems](https://github.com/apprentice-system), and exploring how real-world systems hold together.

I believe in understanding what I use, contributing back, and building tools I wish existed.
> This isnâ€™t a showcase. Itâ€™s a dev log â€” full of trials, errors, and the occasional insight.
