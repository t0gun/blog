When I was early in my career, I saw some trends on LinkedIn and GitHub. Engineers would use adjectives like “aspiring
engineer,” “transitioning,” or other terms that show the person is young in their career, just starting out, or lacking
self-confidence and courage. I also noticed another type of person who was still early in their career but had found
enough confidence to simply call themselves engineers. I made that mistake in the past, but I caught onto the pattern
quickly.

No one hands over opportunities to someone who aspires. Opportunities go to people who have the confidence to learn and
grow. Here’s why: to aspire means to aim to be something. If you have already started, even if you are not knowledgeable
or skilled, you have become the thing you aspired to be. You took the first step by doing work, even if it was shitty.
Any work you do in your career while you still call yourself “aspiring” will never be recognized. No one will see your
work as engineering if you keep positioning yourself as someone who is still trying to become an engineer.
The reason to label yourself as an engineer right after your first work is to accelerate your growth. Your brain will
resist because you know you lack skill and experience, so you train harder to hold that badge. You defend the reputation
you just created for yourself. You know every piece of work from now on has to be done in a production-grade manner.

A songwriter who has written their first song would not call themselves an aspiring singer. A footballer playing their
first match would not say they are an aspiring footballer. If you have taken that first step, then you have become the
thing. Now, defend that reputation.
