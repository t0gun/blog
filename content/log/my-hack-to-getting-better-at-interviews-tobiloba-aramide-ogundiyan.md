I woke up this morning, and I started reflecting on some of the interviews I have done in the recent weeks. I started
reflecting on what could have gone wrong, what I might have missed, and if I was bombing any of my recent interviews.
The truth is that I always have this self-reflection after every interview, and I can remember telling myself I am
getting better each day. For someone like me, I am never good at interviews, not because I am afraid, but because it
wasn't something that felt natural to me. I am not good at it. In fact, my first interviews were terrible. Sometimes I
would go blank and freeze, and all the good stuff I want to talk about just goes away. But for someone like me who has
persevered through different phases, I am always a believer in habits.

What if I haven't gotten better? And what if all the 2-day and one-week preparations are not enough? What if I am the
one jeopardizing every room I got into?

So I am taking the responsibility of interviewing myself every single day indefinitely, on camera for now. Maybe for 30
minutes or more, but the rep just has to be there. I have to tick it on a note as a daily win. I want to see myself on
camera every day. I want to listen to how I talk, and I want to see myself fail before anyone does. Iâ€™m writing this
down because today is my first day of this activity. One rep today, a thousand to go, and I will earn
my clarity on camera
